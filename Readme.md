### Data Analysis and Deep Learning for Housing Dataset

## Preliminary Data Analysis:

# Descriptive Statistics

Start by computing the descriptive statistics of the data frame (df). This provides measures like count, mean, standard deviation, min, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and max for each numeric column.



# Skewness and Kurtosis

Compute skewness and kurtosis to understand the shape and tail behavior of the distribution.

<pre>
```python
skewness = df.skew(numeric_only=True)
kurtosis = df.kurtosis(numeric_only=True)
print("Skewness:")
print(skewness)
print("\nKurtosis:")
print(kurtosis)
```
</pre>



# Visualisation

<pre>
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set_style("whitegrid")

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
sns.barplot(x=skewness.index, y=skewness.values)
plt.title('Skewness of Numerical Columns in DataFrame')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
sns.barplot(x=kurtosis.index, y=kurtosis.values)
plt.title('Kurtosis of Numerical Columns in DataFrame')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
</pre>

# Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering involves the creation or modification of features to gain better insights from the data and improve model accuracy. Some methods include:

Population Density: A feature called "population_density" can be created by dividing "population" by either "total_rooms" or "total_bedrooms".

Rooms per Household: By dividing "total_rooms" by "households", the average number of rooms in each household can be found.

Bedrooms per Room: "bedrooms_per_room" is found by dividing "total_bedrooms" by "total_rooms".

Income per Capita: "income_per_capita" is found by dividing "median_income" by "population".

Age-Category: Grouping "housing_median_age" into categories such as "young", "middle-aged", and "old" may prove beneficial.

Distance to Ocean: Convert the "ocean_proximity" column to numerical values using methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Geographical Clustering: Techniques like k-means clustering can be used on longitude and latitude coordinates to group different neighborhoods or regions.

Interaction Features: Create interaction features by multiplying or combining existing features.

Polynomial Features: Introduce polynomial features by squaring or cubing certain numerical features to capture non-linear relationships.

# Feature Scaling

Ensure numerical features have a similar range by using scaling methods such as Min-Max scaling or Standardization (z-score scaling).

## Model Building and Training

# Configuration for Early Stopping

Early stopping can help prevent overfitting by halting training when validation loss stops improving.

<pre>
```python
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10, restore_best_weights=True, verbose=1)
```
</pre>

# Model Building

A function build_model is defined to create different types of neural network models. The model's architecture can vary based on the type of model (e.g., MLP, DNN) and can also include different optimizers and learning rates.

# Model Training

The function train_model is used to train a given model using the provided data.

Models can be iteratively trained using different combinations of model types, optimizers, and learning rates. Additionally, models are saved after training, and pre-trained models can be loaded to avoid re-training.

# Model Evaluation

Using subplots, the loss metrics from the training process for all the trained models are visualized to compare their performances.

# Conclusion

The above README details the steps for data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and training using a housing dataset. By following this, you should be able to get insights from the data, prepare it for machine learning, and train deep learning models to make predictions.
